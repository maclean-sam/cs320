##### How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
I ensure my work is functional and secure by thoroughly testing every function and method that I created in my program. This can be done using JUnit tests when creating a Java program which easily allows you to view the amount of coverage for a project and allows you to create test cases. Test suites can also be used which can be done by software automation and can significantly cut down costs and boost profits for a business.

##### How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
I interpret the user needs by identifying the requirements for the program that were determined before starting the program. While creating and testing the program, it is important to keep the user in mind and think about how they would react to certain pop ups or scenarios. 

##### How do I approach designing software?
One efficient method of designing software is done by using the Software Development Lifecycle which starts with planning and collecting requirements before moving onto design, implementation, and testing. After the program is deployed, maintenance can be done to maintain the quality of the program and fix bugs that may have been missed in the design or testing phases of the program.
